Center for Medicare Services data

Interesting Questions:
   group_by provider_type, find:
      avg std total_submitted_chrg_amt / total_services
      avg std total_medicare_payment_amt / total_services
      avg beneficiary_average_age, Beneficiary_Average_Risk_Score
      group beneficiaries by disease percent
      group_by provider_state, provider_gender
      sort by most to least expensive provider
      find count, cost ratio by provider_gender
      group by patient gender, patient age range
   other columns: 
     total_medicare_payment_amt vs. total_submitted_chrg_amt
       vs. total_med_medicare_payment_amt (may not include drugs)
   try fit of cost by provider_type, state, zip_code
      (if specialty doesn't exist in zip, state may predict)
      use kNN to find zips near each other, using (lat,long) 
        to find e.g. 9 NN, use as predictors if specialty missing
        from zip (if missing from all 9, expand further?)
        use k-means (?)
      or use (lat,long) of zips as continuous variables in
        prediction, e.g. SVR (regression version of SVC)
        with non-linear kernel
